    <h1>Construction industry sectors</h1>
    <p class="g1">Broadly, there are three sectors of construction: buildings, infrastructure and industrial:</p>
    <h2>Building construction </h2>
    <p class="g2">Building construction is the process of adding structures to areas of land, also known as real property sites. Typically, a project is instigated by or with the owner of the property (who may be an individual or an organisation); occasionally, land may be compulsorily purchased from the owner for public use.</p>
    <h2>Residential construction</h2>
    <p class="g1">''Residential construction may be undertaken by individual land-owners , by specialist housebuilders, by property developers, by general contractors, or by providers of public or social housing.Residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice. Materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used (e.g.: brick versus stone versus timber). <br><hr><br>Costs of construction on a per square meter (or per square foot) basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions, access routes, local regulations, economies of scale (custom-designed homes are often more expensive to build) and the availability of skilled tradespeople.''</p>
