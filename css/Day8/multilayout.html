                The failure
                once again highlights the risks involved in getting a spacecraft to soft-land on the Moon.<br>Even
                though a successful landing has been achieved more than 20 times, including six times with human beings
                on board, the technology clearly has not been mastered yet.Amazingly, except the three Chinese landings
                in the past 10 years, all the successful landings on the Moon happened within a decade between 1966 and
                1976.Luna-25, modern Russia’s first attempt to land a spacecraft on the Moon, has ended in
                failure with the spacecraft crashing onto the lunar surface, Russian space agency Roscosmos said on
                Sunday. The failure

            <p class="nine">Germans would describe the G7 becoming G20 as Zeitenwende, a historic turning point. Of
                course this expansion was not warmly welcomed by some G7 countries who are declining, ageing and anxious
                (descriptions of entitled, hypocritical and selfish are also used but unhelpful). But next month’s G20
                meeting in Delhi celebrates India building the world’s largest democracy on the infertile soil of the
                world’s most hierarchical society. It also celebrates our expanding economic freedoms — formalisation,
                industrialisation, financialisation, urbanisation, and human capital — that will soon make India the
                world’s third-largest economy. Unlike China which forced its citizens to choose between their wallets
                and freedom, India is closer than ever to Gandhiji’s dream of combining mass democracy with mass
                prosperity.<img

            <h3>IND vs IRE 2nd T20: IPL star Rinku Singh lives up to his reputation with 38 off 21 in 33-run win over
                Ireland</h3>

            <p class="ten">Even before Rinku Singh marked the guard for his first international knock, his six-hitting
                reputation preceded him. A group of excited teenagers waved a two-feet banner that pleaded: “One six
                this side please.” The gallery buzzed, anticipation bubbled, and a sweaty expectation filled the stands.
                It has been nearly four months since he muscled himself into their cricket consciousness with a
                five-ball-five-six heist for Kolkata Knight Riders against Gujarat Titans.He would blast 38 off 21 balls
                to turbocharge India to 185 for 5, a total Ireland fell short by 33 runs, and thus lost the series, but
                only after he put the audience through a wringer of emotions. “These are two minutes of fame, yeh log
                joh aaj wah-wah kar rahe hai, wohi log kal gaali bhi denge, if I fail. (If I fail the same people will
                jeer me),” he had once told this newspaper.</p>

                to the national squad might take some more time as the senior selection committee is likely to leave him
                out for the Asia Cup, while Shreyas Iyer’s return also hangs in the balance. The panel headed by Ajit
                Agarkar will meet in Delhi on Monday to pick the squad for the continental tournamentRahul underwent
                surgery on his right thigh a few months ago, while Iyer too went under the knife for a back injury. Both
                players have been trying hard to return to competitive cricket but it’s learnt that the selection
                committee will first assess their fitness reports. It’s the main reason it has summoned National Cricket
                Academy (NCA) head (sports science and medicine) Nitin Patel. ___________________________ <strong>
