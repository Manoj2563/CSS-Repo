        <p>The first huts and shelters were constructed by hand or with simple tools. As cities grew during the Bronze
            Age, a class of professional craftsmen, like bricklayers and carpenters, appeared. Occasionally, slaves were
            used for construction work. In the Middle Ages, the artisan craftsmen were organized into guilds. In the
            19th century, steam-powered machinery appeared, and, later, diesel- and electric-powered vehicles such as
            cranes, excavators and bulldozers.The industry can also be classified into sectors or markets.[7] For
            example, Engineering News-Record (ENR), a US-based construction trade magazine, has compiled and reported
            data about the size of design and construction contractors. In 2014, it split the data into nine market
            segments: transportation, petroleum, buildings, power, industrial, water, manufacturing, sewer/waste,
            telecom, hazardous waste, and a tenth category for other projects.[8] ENR used data on transportation,
            sewer, hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors.</p>
