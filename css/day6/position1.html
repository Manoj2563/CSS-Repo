    <p>The thriving trade between Venice and North Africa and the Middle East (back then Ottoman Empire) brought many
        goods, including coffee, to the Venetian port. From Venice, it was introduced to the rest of Europe. Coffee
        became more widely accepted after it was deemed a Christian beverage by Pope Clement VIII in 1600, despite
        appeals to ban the "Muslim drink". The first European coffee house opened in Venice in 1647.</p>
